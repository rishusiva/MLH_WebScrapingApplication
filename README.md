# WebScraper_2021

## Inspiration
MLH: Share inspired me to complete this project. Especially my guild members. (CUSAT)

## What it does
It scrapes data from Wikipedia pages or webpages in order to increase efficiency.

## How we built it
Built it using VSCode and with the help of my Guild Members.

## Challenges we ran into
Debugging was the biggest challenge. Also, certain webpages were not working with our code.

## What I learned
I learned to work around with python and BeautifulSoup library.

## What's next for WebScraper_2021
I would try to improve the project so that in future it could be used to scrape images too.
